   <h3> About My Projects</h3>
  <p>In my last year in college, I have really learned to fall in love with every step of the process when creating a piece. My desire for learning and understanding people allows me to completely emerge myself in the project. I enjoy talking and connecting with people in the process to better understand the essence of the story.
   I always look forward to every assignment because it’s always a valuable learning experience,
   as there’s always something you can get out of it. Every time I create a piece, I do not just grow more editorially and technically, but I’m also learning something new about the world and the people in it. </p>
