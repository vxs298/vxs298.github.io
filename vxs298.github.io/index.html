    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>


    <p>I am a senior at the University of Miami, where I am about to complete my bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism,
       along with three minors in: Entrepreneurship, Psychology, and Theatre.
      Having lived in three different continents throughout my life has given me the opportunity to experience different cultures
      and reshape my way of thinking about the world. I grew up in Italy where I acquired my bilingual status
      by attending a highly rated British school.  After sixteen years in Milan,
      I moved to China to finish my last two years of High School and acquire my International Baccalaureate (IB).I then moved to Miami to complete my college degree at the University of Miami,
      where I developed new passions and interests. Each new environment opened up a new part of myself, and further developed my creative skills.
      Living around the world has been an incredible and unexpected adventure, where I was presented with
        many life changing experiences.</p>
      <p>I have learned to welcome challenges, because challenges are an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and grow.
      After struggling at the beginning of some of my classes with material and assignments I didn’t think I could properly do,
      I knew I had to get rid of the limiting beliefs that prevented me from succeeding by developing the right mindset and proper attitude.
      I learned to transform the tasks that I find difficult and see as my “enemy” into my “friend”as I realized that my only limit is my mind.
      One of the things that excites me the most is that there is always something new to learn and always room for improvement.
       This is why one of my goals in life is to be in a state of constant growth, because if I am not growing I won’t be satisfied.</p>
